## Overview
Background Subtraction is usually used for stationary scenes, however, with an assumption, a background is plain, we can use a background suppression technique for a moving scene video. This is my work of background subtraction algrotihm for a moving scene. Note that this jupter notebook is analyzing just one of videos (IMG_4296.MOV) since we can use normal background suppression techniques for the second video(orcalab-rubbing-beach-underwater.mp4).

Also, Note that this notebook is the half of all the algorithm procedures (what was in the presentation).
